                                    Having fun is also essential for mental health. Engaging in enjoyable activities can reduce stress and anxiety, boost mood and energy levels, and enhance cognitive function. When we have fun, we release endorphins, natural chemicals in the brain that promote a sense of happiness and well-being.
